# Advent of Code 2024
## Solutions by Parker Lacy

This is a repo containing my solution code for [Advent of Code 2024.](https://adventofcode.com/2024)

Because the owners of Advent of Code ask that input data (which varies by user) is not shared, this code contains paths to files that are not included in the `/data` folder. 

### Running this code

To run this code yourself (presuming this has been made public some time after the completion of the challenge), sign up on the site yourself to get the input data. Then, paste it into the relevant file (i.e., for Day 1, `data/day1input.txt`).

After ensuring the data is where the code expects, run the individual Go file with `go run` (i.e. `go run solutions/day1.go`).
